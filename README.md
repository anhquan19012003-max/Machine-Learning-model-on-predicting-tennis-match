This is the project I did for my undergradute Machine Learning course at Shanghai jiaotong university. Tennis is my hobby so doing the project was a great experience for me. 
•	The dataset can be found at: https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp
•	However, the in the link, the data of each year was in a separated CSV files, so in total, we downloaded 34 different files (1991-2024), and combined it into one united dataset
•	In the code file “Project Feature Engineering”, we included the code for the feature engineering process. That code file can be run using the united dataset
•	The code file “Model Project” contains the models we created for the project, the code is straight forward, it firstly identified the features to be used, training, validation, and test set. Then the code for different models and approaches were done bellow.
